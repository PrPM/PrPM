# PrPM - The *progressive* JS package manager  
  
![PrPM](./community/PrPM.png)  
  
PrPM is an NPM-compatible package manager that is written completely in the C# programming language.  
  
Using **.NET Core**, it is completely cross-platform and works on Linux, Windows and macOS (latter is untested).  
  
It should not be used anywhere, as it is not only not production-ready, it's doesn't even support any of the main features of NPM/Yarn yet.
